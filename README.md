## Linked applications and dependencies

We developed this API to link it to a previously built simple StackOverflow application : [`AMT2020-StackOverflowSimpleVersionGamified`](https://github.com/Gusamaal/AMT2020-StackOverflowSimpleGamified)

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to create a basic Gamification Engine through a REST API. It enables developers to "gamify" their applications, meaning they can link it to their app through HTTP requests giving it information about their users and their actions. Those actions can then be sent to/evaluated by the API to give the users points/badges which they can see in their profile in the application.
